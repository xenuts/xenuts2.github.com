## INTERESTS
Object Detection, Object Tracking, Pattern Recognition, Machine Learning

## EDUCATION
• Jul. 2010 - Present    | __Ph.D.__ | _COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY_ | Northwestern Polytechnical University<br />
• Sept. 2006 - Jul. 2010 | __B.S.__ | _COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY_ | Northwestern Polytechnical University<br />

## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
* [2011.5 - 2011.12] __Towards a Queue-Aware ATM: Monitoring and Managing Queues in front of ATMs__<br />
In order to monitoring queues in front of ATMs, apply stereo camera real-time object tracking approach. With the aid of camera’s real-time tracking, develop a simple application system which can give customer a suggested queue and estimated queuing time.

* [2010.9] __Keyword Spotting based Real-time Dialog System__<br />
Make a question-set limited Dialog System implemented by Keyword Spotting approach with improved Online Garbage Model. My main task is proposing a improved method based on Online Garbage Keyword Spotting Model.

* [2010.9] __Keyword Spotting Tool__<br />
Make a Keyword Spotting Tool which user can dynamically add or remove keywords by hand.
